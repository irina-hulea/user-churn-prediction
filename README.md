# Sparkify music streaming platform - User churn prediction

## Project motivation

Sparkify is a music streaming platform similar to Spotify or YouTube Music. It is crucial for a platform like this to make sure the users like the service and will keep using it.

Given the users traffic on the platform, the purpose of the project is to predict user churn. A churned user is a user who has stopped using an app or more accurately in our case, canceled its account.

After prediction, the platform can take action to keep the users prone to cancellation and give them, for instance, custom discounts or support.

## Technologies used

- all steps from exploratory data analysis to predictions are done in a `Jupyter Notebook` with `Python 3`
- for data analysis and feature engineering I used `Spark SQL`, for visualizations `pandas` and `seaborn` and for classification `Spark ML`

## File Description

- **sparkify-user-churn-prediction.ipynb* 
    - Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and end-to-end user churn detection
